                                            <p>It is a message you wanted in your Inbox, but it arrived in your Junk folder instead</p>

                                            <p>Also be aware that if you are forwarding email anywhere, the forwarded mail is NOT filtered at all!  The spam filter is only applied for our local Physics &amp; Astronomy mailboxes.</p>

Typical methods involve sending you an "official-looking" email to ask for your account information, such as your login ID and especially your password. Or sometimes the email suggests your account is full and asks you to click a link to access your email.</p>

                                            <p>These are all scams, and they're common. Each of them hopes to trick you into clicking on a link where you'll be prompted to share your password or your login credentials to other sites.</p>
