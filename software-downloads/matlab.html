                                                <a href="http://www.library.ucla.edu/clicc/software" target="_blank">http://www.library.ucla.edu/clicc/software</a> as long as you're connected wirelessly to Eduroam and can login using your standard UCLA logon ID. You'll also likely want to use Firefox with pop-up blocker turned off;  the Software Shortcut option doesn't work with Chrome, and Safari is problematical.
