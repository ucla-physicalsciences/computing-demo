<h3 >LDAP User Accounts</h3> <br>
<p>The Physics &amp; Astronomy department utilizes multiple authentication systems for internal IT resources. LDAP is used for SSH gateway access, authentication across departmental websites, and VPN access.</p>
                                            <h4>Requesting an LDAP Account</h4>
                                            <p>If you have a Physics or Astronomy e-mail account, there's a good chance that you already have an LDAP account. To check if you have an LDAP account, try logging in with your e-mail username (the initial portion before the @ symbol) and password.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                If you are unable to login with your e-mail username and password, an LDAP account can be automatically provisioned by logging into the Zimbra webmail interface. To do so, log in at 
                                                <a href="http://mail.physics.ucla.edu">http://mail.physics.ucla.edu</a>
                                                 if you have an @physics.ucla.edu e-mail address, or 
                                                <a href="http://mail.astro.ucla.edu">http://mail.astro.ucla.edu</a>
                                                 if your e-mail address ends in @astro.ucla.edu. By logging into the webmail interface, an LDAP account will be created with the same credentials as your e-mail username and password. Please allow 15-20 minutes for the new account to propagate and try logging into the website again.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                If you encounter any errors during this process, or if you do not have a Physics or Astronomy e-mail account, please

                                                 to have the new password pushed to the LDAP account.
