 <h2>E-Mail</h2><br>
<p>Physics &amp; Astronomy department e-mail accounts are available for faculty, staff, and students. Departmental e-mail accounts are provisioned with 10GB of storage space and provide collaborative functionality including a calendar, address book, task list, and file storage "briefcase." E-mail accounts can be accessed through a webmail interface or client software installed on your computer.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                The department currently maintains separate e-mail systems for the Physics working group and Astronomy working group. E-mail addresses ending in "@physics.ucla.edu" are hosted on the Physics mail server, while e-mail addresses ending in "@astro.ucla.edu" are hosted on the Astronomy mail server. Because of the separation between working groups, 
                                                <strong>e-mail settings and access instructions are not interchangeable</strong>
                                                . The Computing Group is working to merge the two systems.
