                                                Our in-house poster printer is currently being serviced and is not available for poster printing. 
                                                <a href="https://www.mdds.ucla.edu/document-services/full-color-banners-posters-event-displays">We recommend using the printer service at UCLA Document Services</a>
                                                . We expect to be ableÂ to provide poster printing again once service is complete.
