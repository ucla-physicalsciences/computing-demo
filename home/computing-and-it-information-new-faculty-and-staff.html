If you want to run for even longer time, the best solution would be to contribute computer nodes to them. With that they will allow all your group members run jobs for 14 days maximum in your contributed nodes. Besides the standard usual SSH, you can also use NoMachine client to connect to Hoffman2 cluster. Note: Hoffman2 supports compiler for most languages C++/C, Fortran, Python, and also software such as Mathematica, and etc.
